# Version Management Workflow

This repository uses automated version management with GitHub Actions. Version bumps are triggered based on which branch changes are merged to `main`.

## Available Branches

- `version/major` - For breaking changes (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
- `version/minor` - For new features (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
- `version/patch` - For bug fixes (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)

## How to Use

### For Patch Releases (Bug Fixes)
1. Create a branch from `version/patch`:
   ```bash
   git checkout version/patch
   git pull origin version/patch
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   # Make your changes
   git commit -m "fix: your bug fix description"
   git push origin fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. Create a PR targeting `version/patch`
3. Once approved, merge the PR to `version/patch`
4. Create a PR from `version/patch` to `main`
5. When merged to `main`, the workflow will:
   - Bump patch version (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1)
   - Run tests and build
   - Publish to NPM
   - Create a GitHub release

### For Minor Releases (New Features)
1. Create a branch from `version/minor`:
   ```bash
   git checkout version/minor
   git pull origin version/minor
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature
   # Make your changes
   git commit -m "feat: your feature description"
   git push origin feature/your-feature
   ```

2. Create a PR targeting `version/minor`
3. Once approved, merge the PR to `version/minor`
4. Create a PR from `version/minor` to `main`
5. When merged to `main`, the workflow will:
   - Bump minor version (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0)
   - Run tests and build
   - Publish to NPM
   - Create a GitHub release

### For Major Releases (Breaking Changes)
1. Create a branch from `version/major`:
   ```bash
   git checkout version/major
   git pull origin version/major
   git checkout -b breaking/your-breaking-change
   # Make your changes
   git commit -m "feat!: your breaking change description"
   git push origin breaking/your-breaking-change
   ```

2. Create a PR targeting `version/major`
3. Once approved, merge the PR to `version/major`
4. Create a PR from `version/major` to `main`
5. When merged to `main`, the workflow will:
   - Bump major version (e.g., 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0)
   - Run tests and build
   - Publish to NPM
   - Create a GitHub release

## Direct Push to Main
Direct pushes to `main` will trigger a patch version bump by default.

## Required Secrets

Make sure these secrets are configured in your GitHub repository:

- `NPM_TOKEN` - Your NPM authentication token for publishing
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` - Automatically provided by GitHub Actions

## Workflow Features

- ‚úÖ Automatic version bumping based on branch
- ‚úÖ AI-generated changelog using Claude Code CLI
- ‚úÖ Runs tests before publishing
- ‚úÖ Builds the package before publishing
- ‚úÖ Creates git tags with changelog in tag message
- ‚úÖ Publishes to NPM with public access
- ‚úÖ Creates GitHub releases with formatted changelog
- ‚úÖ Prevents publishing if tests fail

## Changelog Generation

The workflow automatically generates a standardized changelog for each release using Claude Code CLI. The changelog analyzes git commits since the last release and categorizes them into:

- üöÄ **Features** - New functionality
- üêõ **Bug Fixes** - Bug fixes and corrections
- üîß **Improvements** - Code improvements and refactoring
- üìö **Documentation** - Documentation updates
- ‚ö° **Performance** - Performance optimizations

The generated changelog is included in:
- The version bump commit message
- The git tag message
- The GitHub release notes

## Version Branch Maintenance

Keep version branches up to date by periodically merging from main:

```bash
git checkout version/patch
git merge main
git push origin version/patch

git checkout version/minor
git merge main
git push origin version/minor

git checkout version/major
git merge main
git push origin version/major
```

This ensures that all version branches have the latest changes from main before creating new features or fixes.
